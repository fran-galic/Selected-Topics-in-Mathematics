# Selected Topics in Mathematics - Combinatorics

This repository contains projects and tasks from the "Selected Topics in Mathematics" course, with a specific focus on solving combinatorial problems using computer algorithms.

## Course Overview:
The course equips students with a deeper understanding of key modern mathematical structures, including areas such as discrete mathematics, combinatorics, algorithm analysis, probability, numerical mathematics, and mathematical modeling. In this repository, I focus specifically on combinatorics and how to solve combinatorial problems efficiently with the help of computers.

## What I Have Learned:
By working on these projects, I have learned to:
- Solve mathematical problems using computational tools.
- Use mathematical methods to tackle real-world problems.
- Write my own mathematical software.
- Define and explore new mathematical structures.
- Compare my problem-solving efficiency with my peers.

## Structure:
- **Lectures**: 4 hours per week covering theoretical and practical aspects of discrete mathematics and combinatorics.
- **Independent Projects**: I worked on a project in combinatorics, with an emphasis on solving combinatorial problems computationally.

## Focus of the Repository:
This repository highlights my work in combinatorics, particularly how I approached and solved combinatorial challenges using algorithmic methods. The examples provided demonstrate practical solutions to combinatorial problems using programming and mathematical tools.
